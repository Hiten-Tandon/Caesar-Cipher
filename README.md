# Caesar-Cipher
This is a program written in java to encode and decode Ceasar Cipher. Improvements can be made to the code so feel free to download the code and fix it and make a pull request
Or perhaps maybe you can help me document it? Either way, feel free to download the code and run it on ur machine.
